# Recipe Checklist

Recipe Checklist is a browser extension for keeping track of ingredients across multiple recipes while you browse recipes across multiple tabs.

## Installation

Use your browser's extension manager to load the contents of this folder.
Tested with Google Chrome for laptop and Kiwi browser for mobile.

## Usage

When navigating to a page on your browser that has a recipe, the extension prepends checkboxes to each ingredient.  
All ingredients are automatically loaded into your ingredient list - which exists as a pop-up (on laptop) or separate tab (on mobile). 
Checking off an ingredient removes it from your recipe list.  Within the ingredient list pop-up (or tab), you can remove an entire recipe or check off individual ingredients.  
Navigate to another recipe on a separate tab, and the new recipe will be added to your existing recipe list.
There is also an open text field for adding additional ingredients of your choice.

The extension has been successfully used with around 20 different recipe websites, but to initially try it out I recommend using the extension with epicurious.com

Enjoy!
